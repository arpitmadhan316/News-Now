        <h1 class="heading">2024 US Election Results: How Trump’s presidency will impact global markets, FPI outflows</h1>
        <section class="news-articles">
            <article>
                <img src="us.webp" alt="Donald Trump">
                <p>
                    With Donald Trump returning to the White House, the US dollar and stock market are expected to
                    benefit, while bonds, emerging markets, clean energy, sustainable investments, and global equities
                    may face pressures under a Republican presidency.
                    Many believe that a second Trump presidency could negatively impact Asia as a whole. However, for
                    India, Trump’s election win is seen as favorable.
                    This scenario would require the Federal Reserve to maintain elevated interest rates to control
                    economic expansion, benefiting the dollar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Impact interest rate:</b> The Federal Reserve is expected to maintain alignment with US government
                    policies, though speculation suggests lower rates under a potential Trump administration.
                    US bond yields are anticipated to increase, potentially impacting the Federal Reserve's interest
                    rate reduction strategy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Market performance analysis:</b> Both US and Indian markets showed positive movement, reflecting the
                    perception that Trump's anti-China and pro-Russia positioning could benefit India more than a Harris
                    administration.
                    Despite this optimism, trade and tariff concerns persist. India's potential advantages include
                    developments in iCET, the GE-HAL Engine collaboration, and reduced supply chain dependence on China.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>FII investments:</b> A Trump victory could strengthen the US dollar and enhance US asset attractiveness,
                    possibly leading to some foreign portfolio outflows from India.
                    However, India's strategic importance in countering China through Quad may attract increased Foreign
                    Direct Investment in manufacturing, defence technology, and Global Capability Centres. The trend
                    suggests a shift towards FDI rather than FII investments in the medium term.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Domestic growth potential:</b> Countries with domestic growth potential and reform agendas, such as
                    India or South Africa, might become stable options amidst global volatility. Chile's copper and
                    lithium exports could remain relatively unaffected due to their essential nature.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Depreciation of China's yuan:</b> Financial experts predict the euro could fall below $1 if tariffs and
                    domestic tax reductions are implemented. They also anticipate further depreciation of China's yuan,
                    similar to the decline observed during 2018-2020.
                    Increased dollar yields are expected to revive carry-trades, with the Japanese yen and Swiss franc
                    experiencing significant selling before the election.
                    Bitcoin could benefit from a Trump administration's more lenient approach to cryptocurrency
                    regulation. The primary cryptocurrency reached unprecedented heights on Wednesday.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Tax reduction plans:</b> Goldman Sachs calculates that reducing corporate tax rates from 21per cent to
                    15per cent would enhance S&P 500 earnings by approximately 4%.
                    However, uncertainty remains regarding congressional approval of Trump's tax reduction plans.
                    Additionally, his protectionist policies and firm stance towards China could increase costs, reduce
                    profits, and affect multinational corporations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Fossil fuel sectors are expected to benefit:</b> Trump's agenda of reduced corporate regulation, lower
                    taxes, expanded oil production, and strict immigration controls suggests increased growth and
                    inflation, generally favourable for equities. Banks, technology, defence, and fossil fuel sectors
                    are expected to benefit.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Renewable energy likely to experience volatility:</b> Sectors vulnerable to tariff adjustments,
                    including semiconductors, automobiles, and renewable energy, are likely to experience volatility.
                    Investors anticipating election results have reduced positions in Japanese stocks, particularly
                    automakers, and European electric vehicle and semiconductor shares.
                    Trump's policy implications have already impacted emerging economies. Beyond Chinese tariffs, he
                    proposes up to 200per cent tariffs on Mexican vehicle imports. Analysts suggest Mexico's peso could
                    depreciate beyond 21 per dollar, reaching two-year lows.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Iranian oil sanctions:</b> Conversely, heightened enforcement of Iranian oil sanctions could reduce
                    global crude availability. Additionally, his pledge to unprecedented Strategic Petroleum Reserve
                    levels could boost prices through government market participation.
                    Trump's administration would prioritise maximising US petroleum production through expanded federal
                    leasing and reduced environmental regulations, securing America's position as the leading petroleum
                    producer. This substantial supply could maintain relatively low prices for US West Texas
                    Intermediate crude futures, which declined approximately 4per cent this year.
