        <h1 class="heading">South Korea's Ex-Defence Minister Allegedly Behind Martial Law Advice Attempts Suicide Using Underwear</h1>
        <section class="news-articles">
            <!-- Article 1 -->

                <p>
                    South Korea's former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun, who claimed full responsibility for the
                    president's failed attempt to place the country under martial law last week, has tried to take his
                    own life, an official said.

                    Authorities found him while making the attempt in his detention centre on Tuesday night, Shin
                    Yong-hae, the justice ministry's correctional agency chief, told lawmakers.

                    In the wake of Yoon's shock martial law order, Kim resigned last week along with other top
                    presidential staff.

                    He had been detained on Sunday for investigation, before he was formally arrested on insurrection
                    charges.

                    Kim was in stable condition following the attempt, Shin said.</p>

                <p>
                    Kim is among top officials who are facing investigations for their role in Yoon's short-lived martial
                    law order, which has sparked widespread fury in South Korea.

                    Tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets calling for the president's resignation or
                    impeachment.

                    Yoon is also being investigated for alleged insurrection. While he has apologised for the martial
                    law declaration, he has not accepted growing calls for him to step down.

                    Kim, who was named defence minister in September, said he apologised "deeply" in a statement on
                    Tuesday and said "all responsibility for this situation lies solely with me".

                    "Deeply apologises for causing significant anxiety to the public. He said all responsibility for the
                    martial law imposition rests with him and pleaded for leniency for soldiers </p>

                <p>
                    Deployed to enforce it," the former defence minister of South Korea said in a statement.Yong Hyun is
                    one of Yoon's close associates. He is accused of recommending martial law to

                    Yoon and sending troops to the National Assembly to block lawmakers from voting on it. However,
                    enough lawmakers managed to enter a parliament chamber and they unanimously rejected

                    the President's decree and forced the Cabinet to lift it before daybreak on December 4.Meanwhile,
                    President Yoon Suk Yeol's office resisted a police attempt to search the compound, reported The
                    Associated Press.

                    The main liberal opposition Democratic Party is reportedly planning to introduce a new motion to
                    impeach Yoon for his December 3 declaration that imposed martial law in South Korea for the first
                    time in over four decades.

                    Notably, the first impeachment attempt against Yoon last Saturday failed after ruling party
                    lawmakers boycotted the vote. The opposition party said it plans to submit the new motion on
                    Thursday to set up a vote on Saturday, reported the news agency.

                    After Yoon's announcement to impose martial law, financial markets crashed. On Wednesday, rival
                    North Korea's state media for the first time reported about South Korea's political crisis.</p>

                <p>
                    Later on Wednesday, police detained National Police Agency Commissioner General Cho Ji Ho and Kim
                    Bong-sik, head of Seoul's metropolitan police. They were accused of deploying police forces to
                    parliament to block lawmakers from voting.

                    Meanwhile, Yoon on Saturday apologised over the martial law decree, saying that he won't avoid legal
                    or political responsibility for it
