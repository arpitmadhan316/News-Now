                <p>
                    The Nobel Prizes stem from the foundation established by Swedish entrepreneur and inventor of
                    dynamite, Alfred -Nobel, and include a certificate, a medal, and a monetary award of 11 million
                    Swedish kronor (approximately €950,000). The prizes have been presented by King Carl XVI Gustaf of
                    Sweden in the Stockholm Concert Hall on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel’s death. First awarded
                    in 1901, this year marks the 115th occasion.

                    The ceremony during the Nobel Prize Week is accompanied by concerts, art exhibitions, and the Nobel
                    lectures given by the laureates. Among the speakers are the US researchers Victor Ambros and Gary
                    Ruvkun, who are awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology for their discovery of microRNA,
                    as well as David Baker, Demis Hassabis, and John M. Jumper, who share the Nobel Prize in Chemistry
                    for their work on computational protein design and AI-driven predictions of protein folding from
                    amino acid sequences.

                <h2>MicroRNA – a therapeutic target</h2>

                <p>
                    The Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm has honoured groundbreaking basic
                    research
                    with this year’s Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology,
                    which are already influencing clinical drug development. In their laudatory address, the jury
                    described
                    the discovery of the first regulatory microRNAs carried
                    out by developmental biologist Victor Ambros (71, University of Massachusetts Medical School,
                    Worcester)
                    and geneticist Gary Ruvkun (72, Massachusetts General
                    Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston) as a “new dimension of gene regulation”. Today,
                    microRNAs
                    represent promising therapeutic targets for conditions such
                    as heart failure, cancer, and metabolic disorders.</p>

                <h2>Rewriting Gene Regulation</h2>

                <p>
                    The discovery of microRNAs challenged the prevailing belief at the time that genes could only be
                    regulated by proteins. At the time, both Ambros and Ruvkun were
                    postdoctoral researchers in the laboratory of Nobel laureate Robert Horvitz at the Massachusetts
                    Institute of Technology (MIT), studying two mutated genes in the
                    nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Ambros demonstrated that the lin-4 gene inhibits the activity of
                    lin-14
                    and does not code for a protein, but rather a microRNA that
                    is just 22 nucleotides long. As Ruvkun found, this microRNA binds to the lin-14 mRNA through an
                    antisense mechanism, blocking its translation. Their 1993 findings were
                    initially met with little attention, but this changed with the discovery of the highly conserved
                    microRNA let-7 in Ruvkun’s lab. It was soon clear that this newly discovered
                    universal mechanism had been in existence for over 500 million years in all multicellular organisms.

                <h2>The advent of AI</h2>

                <p>
                    The Nobel Prize in Chemistry has also been deemed groundbreaking by the Nobel Committee of the Royal
                    Swedish Academy of Sciences. It marks a milestone in the rapid adoption of
                    Artificial Intelligence in research and drug development. David Baker (62, University of Washington
                    and
                    Howard Hughes Medical Institute) enabled the rapid and reliable prediction
                    of protein structures using AI algorithms, providing an alternative to time-consuming methods like
                    X-ray
                    crystallography. His Rosetta algorithm could predict 3D protein structures
                    that were previously known. By having the software predict the appropriate amino acid sequence for a
                    desired structure, Baker was able to design an entirely new range of proteins.
                    The freely available version, Rosetta@home, theoretically allows anyone to become a protein
                    designer.
                    The de novo design of proteins, enhanced by AI, enables nearly unlimited new
                    creations – including the development of innovative therapies.</p>

                <h2>Protein folding 2.0</h2>

                <p>The foundation for the accurate prediction of protein folding was laid by British scientist
                    Demis Hassabis (48) and US researcher John M. Jumper (39) at Google DeepMind. Hassabis,
                    a neuroscientist, chess player, and former video game developer, founded his own development
                    studio and later DeepMind Technologies in London, which was acquired by Google Health for
                    around $400 million in 2014. There, he trained the AI model AlphaFold using a vast protein
                    database and, together with Jumper, developed the impressive successor AlphaFold2, which
                    delivered
                    protein structures with accuracy comparable to X-ray crystallography and was followed more
                    recently by a third version. This breakthrough allowed the two AI researchers to predict the
                    structure of all known single proteins.
                    Today, millions of users worldwide use the AI model, expanding the known range of protein
                    structures. When combined with Baker’s research, AlphaFold even facilitates the simulation
                    of protein interactions, paving the way for the design of biologics.
                    These are already being commercialized by companies, heralding a new era in therapeutic
                    development.</p>
