                <h2>India should propose a trade-tech-investment package deal to Trump: Mukesh Aghi</h2>
                <img src="international-relations1.avif" alt="International news image 1">
                <p>
                    Mukesh Aghi is the chair of the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF). Aghi, who shares close relationships with top decision-makers in both countries, has played a key role in deepening India-US ties as he has helped governments, and the private sector build on convergences.Trump 2.0 will avoid all the mistakes he made in 1.0. He is going to come with a clearly-defined agenda. He will come with clearly-defined people and he will have an execution plan which is 30, 60 and 90 days. 
                    So, you will see a Trump administration which won’t be floundering but will focus on execution and efficiency.The US spends roughly a trillion dollars on its defence budget. It has around 750 bases around the world. Trump is going to question that. Do we need these bases? Do we need to be out in all these wars? I think you will see a massive shift taking place from that perspective.
                    Second, he wants to create jobs at home, and he thinks that the best way to create jobs at home is to stop importing and start manufacturing. So, he will put tariffs. The biggest supplier of goods to the US is China. So, he will put higher tariffs on China hoping that some manufacturers will move back and that’s going to create jobs. There will be challenges because all indications are once you put tariffs, it drives inflation. 
                    Once it drives inflation, the Fed will keep the interest rate high. When you keep the interest rate high, the dollar gets stronger. So, it gets much more expensive to export from the US side also. So there has to be a balance.You will see a stress point happening with China because the Chinese economy is not what it was during first Trump term. That time, it was booming. Now, it is struggling. Real estate assets are in a downward spiral. 
                    Its deficit has gone up. China is at a weak stage economically at the moment, but it’s a country which has its own ambition to be the dominant power.We have to understand Trump’s endgame; create jobs here in America. And he feels creating jobs here is mainly through manufacturing. So, to bring back manufacturing, he will raise the tariff. He is going to put a lot of pressure on US companies to relocate their supply chain. 
                    He’s going to put a lot of pressure on the Chinese. And at some stage when you see a massive disruption happening with the high tariffs, it’s going to have an impact on US companies immediately because complex supply chain comes from both US and also international markets. So, if you start putting tariffs on them, US exports become expensive. So, he will have to make a deal.

                    Anoushka Kale, a 20-year-old British Indian student, has been elected president of Cambridge University's historic Cambridge Union Society, one of the world's oldest debating societies.Kale secured 126 votes to be elected uncontested for the next Easter 2025 term in the recently held elections for the Union, PTI reported.

                    In her team, Kale said she will look to expand diversity and access at the Union through greater collaborations with culture groups. "I am also especially passionate about continuing to host international speakers and global debate motions, as I did as Debates Officer of the society," she added.Kale, who is studying English Literature at Sidney Sussex College at Cambridge University, is among the few South Asian women to take on this prestigious role.
                    “I’m looking forward to delivering on my manifesto promises, particularly on expanding diversity through society collaborations and reduced access tickets for the summer garden party,” the British Indian student was quoted as saying by PTI.Like Oxford University, Cambridge's Union Society also has a long-standing tradition of hosting key figures from fields of public life. 
                    The guest list ranges from US presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan to UK Prime Ministers Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher and John Major to Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates and the Dalai Lama.

                <h2>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle ‘have invited Princess Eugenie’ for…</h2>
                <img src="international-relations3.avif" alt="International news image 3">
                <p>
                    Princess Eugenie has reportedly “received invitations” to spend Christmas with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in California and with the Royal Family at Sandringham. According to a royal insider, the Princess of York is said to be exploring ways to balance the competing commitments.
                    “Harry and Meghan have invited Eugenie and Jack to join them in California during the holidays,” a source told Express. “It’s a very difficult position for Eugenie because she has also been invited to Sandringham.”Eugenie and her husband, Jack Brooksbank, share two young children who are close in age to Prince Archie, five, and Princess Lilibet, three. The insider suggested, “It would be so nice for the children to spend time with their cousins.”
                    “The diary is very tight over the holidays, but there might be a slot free around New Year’s time for everyone to come together at some point.”The invitation comes amid Eugenie’s close relationship with Prince Harry and Meghan. She notably appeared in their Netflix documentary, Harry & Meghan, and the Sussexes are said to have purchased a holiday home in Portugal near Eugenie’s residence. Daily Mail reported that the couple hooked Sussexes up with the Portugal property deal.
                    Despite her bond with Harry, “She is always trying to manage a difficult balancing act, which can become quite tiresome at times. Eugenie doesn’t want to jeopardize the family’s renewed goodwill efforts,” the insider revealed.
                    Eugenie’s absence from Princess Kate’s Together at Christmas event at Westminster Abbey further fueled speculation. Her older sister, Princess Beatrice, represented the York family at the gathering alongside her husband, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, and his son, Christopher Woolf.“Eugenie and Harry were at one point almost inseparable,” the source concluded. “They have maintained a bond in recent years and are keen for their children to share a close family connection as they grow up.”
